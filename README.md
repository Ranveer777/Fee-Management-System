# FEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

We have developed Fee Payment System to provide online fee payment gateway and easy maintenance of fee records submitted by students. So, we call it as Fee Management System which shows all the fee records of student and scholarships.

Fee Management System is to automate the paper work of fee system and reduce the work load of banks and college by using online payment mode. Fees is decided upon the caste of the student, admission year and the scholarship approved for the student. Fees is calculated as sum of tuition fee, development fee.

This system can lead to error free, secure and reliable and fast fee submission reducing the work of account department of the college.
